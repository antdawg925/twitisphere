This application is written in JavaScript to display the front end and Python to handle the backend.

To run this application requires installing the packages required to run the Flask(Python)-app and React(JS)-app 
and have terminals running for the Flask and React app indipendently. 

------------------------------------------- Install Flask Packages -------------------------------------------
Depending on your python setup you may need to use -
python -m pip
  or just 
pip

make sure to cd into "server" folder
packages need to be installed to pipenv shell-
1. python -m pip install flask 
(to enter python shell and install packages to shell)
2. python -m pipenv shell
3. python -m pipenv bcrypt
4. python -m pipenv pymysql

------------------------------------------- Install React Packages -------------------------------------------
First you must install node_modules which is not posted to github because .gitignore
To install node_modules cd into "client-master" folder
1. npm i
(i is short for install)

Must install axios to make requests to Python server
2. npm i axios
Need to install react-router-dom which allows front end routes to work
3. npm i react-router-dom

Tailwind was used to customize front end, may or may need to be installed. 
2. npm install -D tailwindcss
3. npx tailwindcss init

These should be all the packages necessary to run this application! If anything is missing from the Python server 
it should be indicated and sugested in the terminal. 

Thanks for stopping by!! :)
